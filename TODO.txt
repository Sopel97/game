Basic tiles will be registerd at tile database at compile time (they have no static tile data nor id, it's only template with methods)
Actual tile types will be loaded from assets and made on base tiles templates (base tile name in tile asset identifies name of template tile) Static tile data is loaded for every type.
Tiles for use in world will be produced (copied) from tile types when needed by id or name.

Same system will be made for other world objects which will be loaded from assets.


clear_to_color seems to not work properly with aplha, try using prim drawing instead

Drawing of foreground tile borders.
For every appearing tile every unique neighbour draws border on it.

field in StaticTileData for information if tile is solid or not

RandomlySpreadingSolidTile class for tiles that randomly spread (like grass) with customizable range, probablity (in average gameticks/spread), required neighbour (certain tiles, only solids, nonsolids), allowed targets of spread (in similar format as required neighbour)

Background layer with separate tile drawing functions (sprites stay the same) (every tile at background should not have inner border and have outer border only with air)
darkened at drawing by constant factor

!!! we no longer do inner borders. Only outer borders will be present.
