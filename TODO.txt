Basic tiles will be registerd at tile database at compile time (they have no static tile data nor id, it's only template with methods)
Actual tile types will be loaded from assets and made on base tiles templates (base tile name in tile asset identifies name of template tile) Static tile data is loaded for every type.
Tiles for use in world will be produced (copied) from tile types when needed by id or name.

Same system will be made for other world objects which will be loaded from assets.


!!! MAY BE IMPORTANT !!! drawing tiles may be too slow, think of a way to speed up drawing tiles in the tiles' drawing methods and consider making buffer for map and update it (move when camera moves, redraw/draw tiles which appear due to moving or need redraw) when needed. This should increase performance by a lot, but may be problematic to maintain later.
