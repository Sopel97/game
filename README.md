This is a personal library. You can use it if you want but I don't guarantee all features are present or working correctly or optimal.

Features are being made when needed. Some things are declared but not implemented yet.
Some parts of code are borrowed from all over the internet. I try to note the original author but it's not done everywhere yet.
